# Fitbit-vinculation-via-Java-Webapp
In this project I developed an implementation of Fitbit api with java beans and servlets to sync a patient to an fitbit account, It has 3 levels of login with Doctor, nurse and IT.

The main focus of this project was to make a real solution to a real problem, that's why we interacted with the General HOspital of Mexico, to find the solution for this new application.

The system was developed with Java servlets and Java beans to manage the MVC of the system.
